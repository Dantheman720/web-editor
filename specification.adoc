:working: pass:normal[+[&#10140;]+]

The basic specification will probably end up becoming a living document.
Please make use of the checkboxes to indicate what has been completed.
The following are the different types of checkboxes:

----
{open}
{closed}
{working}
----

and look like this:


{open} -- open
{closed} -- closed
{working} -- working

Adding a git treeish next to checkbox in parens as the work is done would also be a nice touch.
